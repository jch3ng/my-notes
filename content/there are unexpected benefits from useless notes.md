Long tail bets on emergent value. Obsidian makes this cheap. This is both a strength and weakness of mine. They are ideas or thoughts I might not ever share but they seem worth saving ... "just in case" (because [[Collectorâ€™s Fallacy|being a collector is okay|]]; and [[there are unexpected benefits from useless notes]]). 

Not all [[Obsidian]] notes are well baked/internalized or well written. This is both good and bad: 
- good: I have a somewhat relevant sample of what I intuitively guess might be valuable later one. 
- bad: the feeling of overwhelm when noticing the volume of notes. This is countered by Obsidian's search and filtering abilities. 

... but sometimes I'll inject some randomness into my pool of Obsidian notes. 

i'll ingest notes 

- or where I can meander, explore. It might not connect to any project (currently). It might be day-to-day trivia... like I log what I ate the other day...
