This is my "digital garden" of notes. There have been many note gardens that have come before me and many more will come from others. These are my notes. 

I joined the [[Obsidian]] bandwagon around October 2021. 

 The main reason I bother with this is ... I have seen firsthand the emergent value of taking notes (or making notes) and this will be one goal of these notes, to focus on demonstrating this (over time). 

Disclaimer: For various reasons I don't currently [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)  (but I respect this, and maybe I'll get there). 

## Log

In one way this is about:
- Obsidian
- DevOps
- SRE
- Computer Security (Cybersecurity)

... but actually how things overlap. 
I'll start with Obsidian.
