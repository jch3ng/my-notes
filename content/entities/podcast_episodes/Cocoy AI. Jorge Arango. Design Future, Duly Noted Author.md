## Transcript

JORGE ARANGO: I left my career in architecture when the web came out. As you might deduce from that, I was very excited about the web, right? And I am incredibly excited about the stuff that is happening in AI right now, LLMs in particular. I have not been this excited about a technology since I saw the web, frankly. I think it's super important what is happening.

TIFFANY: Hi. Welcome to Kikoye. I I am Tiffany, and I am excited to bring another interview. Jorge Arango, kokoy AI. We talk about career advice, growth mindset, making money, and the future with AI.

I wanted to introduce Jorge. He's an information architect and adjunct professor at California College of the Arts, my alma mater, and author of duly noted, and I will link to it in my description. Jorge is a great design leader, and I'd love to give him the opportunity to introduce himself and describe his vision and mission of Duly Noted.

JORGE ARANGO: Efani, it's such a pleasure to be here. Thank you for inviting me. My background is in architecture. So I was trained in the design of buildings. That was a long time ago, and I was thinking this morning that I'm coming up on 30 years that I left architecture to get into what we now call user experience design.

And what happened to me in my career is that a couple of years after I graduated from university, the World Wide Web happened. And that was such a shift in the world. And for people who were paying attention at the time, which I was, it was evident that this was a technology that was going to change things in very meaningful and deep ways. And I basically left my career in architecture to get into designing for the web. And I had this, you can call it intuition or a hunch, that the things that I had learned about designing buildings would somehow be applicable in this space.

And that turned out to be a good hunch. I ended up gravitating toward information architecture, which is a pretty broad field. But specifically here, we're talking about structuring digital experiences so that people can find and understand things so that they ultimately can get things done or can get the things they need, find what they need. And I've been working in that space ever since. I've worked as a leader of a design studio.

I founded what, at the time was the first web design studio in Central America, And I had a stint working internally in an organization, a very large multinational organization, helping with their web stuff. Forward many years, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. I've worked on a few books. You mentioned Duly Noted, but I was also coauthor of the 4th edition of the O'Reilly Paul Harber book on information architecture. And I also wrote a book which came out in 2018 called Living in Information, which is a book about information architecture as well.

I'm also a podcaster. So like you, I do a podcast. It's also about information architecture. It's called The Informed Life, and the tagline is that it's about how people organize information to get things done. And that kind of leads us to the subject of the new book, Duly noted, which is applying principles from information architecture for digital products to our own knowledge, to our own notes.

And personal knowledge management is a field that has been experiencing a sort of renaissance, I would say, over the last 3 to 5 years, perhaps, there's been a slew of new products, new applications in the market that let us manage our personal knowledge in ways that were previously available only in labs. And that's very exciting. And I thought the time was right to write a book about, a for our personal things. And that's what this is, and it's one of my several focuses these days.

TIFFANY: What came first? Being drawn to this idea of notes and connect connected notes or the idea of writing a book? How did you get into that?

JORGE ARANGO: The first book project that I was involved with was the 4th edition of The Polar Bear Block. And I did not think that I would write a book about note taking at that time. I very quickly realized that in order to do a good job at that project, I needed to manage the ideas that were going to go into that book. When working on a new edition for an existing book, that's a different challenge than starting a book from scratch. Right?

Because you're starting with a text that exists, and I was not an a co author of the first three editions. I was brought in for the 4th one to help Lou and Peter, the original authors. That's a blessing because I had this experience of starting this project with an existing text, but it quickly became evident that I needed ways to manage the ideas that would go into editing that book. And and, of course, I've been taking notes prior to working on that book. If nothing else, working both in an agency context, in a corporate context, and then as a as an independent consultant, you have to keep pretty good notes of things like meeting minutes and research materials and stuff like that.

Note taking has always been a part of my work, but it really wasn't until the last, I would say, 3 or so years when new tools, like I said, started appearing in the market that I thought maybe the time is right to to really dive into this subject more seriously and not not like I've been doing it, which is just like cribbing stuff from the work I've been doing as an IA for my own use.

TIFFANY: You mentioned in the book of using Obsidian. Is that the one that you use? Is that the one of choice? Why Obsidian versus Notion or Notes that's already in an Apple or notes that's already in an Apple computer?

JORGE ARANGO: There's been something of a renaissance. There are lots of really interesting products out there to do this kind of stuff. You've mentioned 2 of what I think of are the most popular, Apple Notes and Notion. I would venture that most people listening to this conversation might have seen 1 or both of those. Obsidian is not as well known, and in the book first of all, to answer your question directly, yes, that's primarily what I use.

And I but it's not the only tool that I use. I use several other tools, some of which I write about and duly note it as well. But the reason why I featured Obsidian in the book is because I didn't want to be this to be a book about the theory of how to take better notes. I actually wanted to show readers how to do it. And Obsidian has a few characteristics that make it ideal for that purpose.

One is that it's available for free for personal use, at least as of the recording of this conversation. It's a commercial product, so it's not open source. So maybe if you're listening 2 years from now or something, maybe they will have changed their model. But right now, it is free for personal use, and that immediately lowers the barrier to entry. But more importantly, from my perspective, Obsidian, it in the back end, it saves your work as text files on your computer.

So if you think about how Notion works, Notion is it's also a note taking app. It's like note taking with superpowers, but your notes all live in the cloud in Notion's servers. And Notion is, at this point, a fairly established company. I think they're a trustworthy provider, but I really like the idea that my work, particularly my knowledge work, lives on my computer, and it lives in a very open format. So Obsidian saves notes as markdown files, which are plain text files.

And that means that if Obsidian, the company, should disappear, I can just take my folder full of plain text markdown notes and use it with another application. In fact, I already do that. I index my Obsidian note folders in another application called Devontheme, which can read text files on the Mac and do a whole bunch of other things with it. So I like the openness. I like the flexibility.

I like the community. It has a very active community of people developing plug ins, so it's got an open architecture, and people have extended its capabilities in in really incredible ways. They do. There are plugins, for example, to to leverage, large language models with your notes through Obsidian. So it's a very powerful and flexible application.

It's not the only one. But I had to pick one for the book, and I chose that one. It's the one I use. And right now, it's the one I do recommend.

TIFFANY: I love that you have an actionable ask in your book. Do it, not just theorize it. I feel like more books should have this tactical piece of advice. How do you implement it as you're going along? For me, I want a much more visual note taking thing.

So I end up using stuff like GoodNotes or even Miro because you can draw right in there on an iPad, and it's still digital, and you can still have text. Text is a lot easier to type than write, but I can draw something right next to the thing. I think it stems from just my background of being a visual thinker. But I think you can just put it in Notion. Like, that's the only way I use Notion is put the link in there.

Put the link in there so there's a record of where to find the thing.

JORGE ARANGO: Let me chime in on that because I when I mentioned that I use several apps, and I too am a something of a visual thinker. Like, I like to I not only think by typing out notes, I also sketch, and I like to write by hand as well. 

And like you, I use an app on the iPad to do that. I don't use [[GoodNotes]]. I use [[Notability]], which is similar. Both GoodNotes and Notability let you take notes long hand by writing with the [[Apple Pencil.]] And both of these apps have an incredible superpower, which is that they OCR your handwriting so that you can search it later, which is incredibly powerful.

TIFFANY: Edible.

### Jorge's workflow for PDF'd handwritten notes to Obsidian as system of record 

JORGE ARANGO: And and what I do, because I do have to have kind of a system of record, and for me, the system of record is [[Obsidian]]. What I do is I have [[Notability]], and I'll say, I don't know that if you can do this with GoodNotes, but I'll just describe how I do it with Notability. No but [[Notability]] has a setting that lets you back up your notes as PDF files to a Dropbox folder, or it can also be to a Google Drive folder or some cloud folder provider. Right? I just happen to use Dropbox for this, and what I do is have it set so that every night, it creates PDF files of my handwritten notes, and it places them on a Dropbox folder.

And that Dropbox folder gets synced with my Mac. And from there, I take my handwritten notes, and I can drag and drop them into notes in Obsidian so that I have a record of my if I for example, let's take this conversation you and I are having right now. I'm not actually taking notes by hand, but if I was, I would have a record and I I would have a little note in Obsidian that would document this meeting, and I now have a note for you. There's an entry in my Obsidian for Tiffany Chin, and and I will record that we were in a meeting today, and I would drag and drop the PDF to that little container node. And that allows me to have my cake and eat it too because now I have a handwritten note, but I also have this structure that says, on a particular date, I met with Tiffany.

And then afterwards, I can look at the Tiffany note, and I can see all the times that we've met with hyperlinks to them,

TIFFANY: which is incredible. That connection. The amazing tools that are coming out, that's what my next question is. With AI and LLMs coming out, and you have alluded to it further on into your book, how have you been integrating AI into your workflow?

### how have you been integrating AI into your workflow?

JORGE ARANGO: The first thing I'll say is that we're about to start talking about territory that is very fluid right now. Right? This stuff is emergent and very it's changing a lot. I'll also say this. I mentioned earlier that I left my career in architecture when the web came out.

As you might as you might deduce from that, I was very excited about the web, right? And I am incredibly excited about the stuff that is happening in AI right now, LLMs in particular. I have not been this excited about a technology since I saw the web, frankly. I think it's super important what is happening. And one of the reasons why I do use text based tools like Obsidian primarily for my note taking is because text is the lingua franca for these things.

Something like ChatGPT is gonna have an easier time working with your typed out notes than it will with your handwritten notes. I'll say that. It's not to say that you can't use it with handwritten notes, but you have to jump through more hoops. I think that the potential for these things is wide open right now. I think of them primarily as assistants.

In in the way that I write about it in the book is you can think of there being a continuum for technologies between technologies that have no impact at all and technologies on one extreme, right, and then technologies that completely replace us in another extreme. And you could see how, for some tasks, large language models and other types of generative AI can replace a lot of human labor. But for me and and my work, I am most interested in how these things can augment my work. So they sit somewhere in the middle of that continuum. I don't want the AI to type things out for me or to write text for me, but I do want it to nudge me into thinking in different ways about things, Maybe helping me helping me see the weaknesses in my arguments.

TIFFANY: Mhmm.

JORGE ARANGO: Helping it or having it help me edit my texts or having it help me summarize things that I've read. I'm using it in all of those capacities and, frankly, discovering new things to do with it all the time. So I'm incredibly excited about it. For personal knowledge management, one of the potentially super powerful uses for this stuff is to help you start spotting patterns and relationships and perhaps generating insights from your own work that you might not have come up with yourself. Right.

I haven't used it in that capacity, but you could imagine how that could be something that would be feasible. And and I mentioned that there are plug ins for Obsidian that let you do this. One of the plug ins, which frankly I haven't experimented with a lot yet, basically lets you index your vault. Vault is what Obsidian calls your knowledge collection of notes. It lets you query your vault so that you can have a conversation with it much like you would with chat GPT but based on your notes.

Right? So if you've been taking notes for a long time with this stuff, all of a sudden, you have this system that can parse that and that can answer questions about your own stuff. Sounds really intriguing. Right?

TIFFANY: And it can broaden it. One of the things that I'm really excited about is the connections it can make with its vast knowledge of everything, of using my own data and then connecting it with analogies of other industries that maybe are doing something similar to your point, like connecting things in ways that we never really imagined possible in a very fast, hyper speed way. I think that is really fascinating, and it makes me think about this next generation of what what is to come. I know you wrote an article about what is the future of design. What do they look like?

What do you think key skills emerging designers or leaders should focus on in this new future? What is left?

JORGE ARANGO: You mentioned at the top of the episode when doing the introduction that I'm that I teach at the California College of the Arts. So this is a question that's highly relevant to me. It's one that I think about every year as I work with a new cohort of students because these are folks who are going to university to learn skills that hopefully will help them in their work when they graduate. And I think about that in the current context and find it, frankly, intimidating in that, my gosh, there's so much change happening. What I tell my students is that one assumption that I'm making, at least in in my own work, is that the more craft like aspects of the work, In the case of user experience design, that could be something like screen level design where you're moving boxes around in Figma.

I think it's pretty fair to assume that kind of stuff is going to be highly automated. I don't think that it's going to be that human designers are gonna are gonna be replaced outright, but the tools are going to make things like script layout and selection of screen level components so much easier and faster that there's going to be less of a need for people working at that level? And where does that leave designers, particularly designers who are just getting started in the field? In my mind, that implies that you need to focus on kind of higher order design challenges. So rather than thinking about what is this say how is this thing going to work or what is it going to look like, the questions that you should be looking to answer answer are things like, what is this thing?

What does it need to be? Or how what does it need to be to add value both to the people who use it and to the organization that who is commissioning it? So questions that are a bit more strategic. The object of that kind of design if you think of the object of the of screen level design to be like screens, The object of that second kind of design are not screens. It's models.

So coming up with these conceptual models of what are the key things that this system needs to do, what do they need to be called, and how do they need to work together to enable certain capabilities. It's a little bit more abstract, but but I think that's an area where designers are going to have work to do for a while. I think that is harder to automate, not impossible. And by the way, that work too can be augmented through automation. But I think that ultimately, the buck stops with humans at this level.

And and I think that you need to be conversant on the tools that will take that kind of very abstract conceptual modeling level of design and transform it into things that people can actually interact with. You need to know how those things work under the hood and what the impact of your decisions are down the line. But I don't think that there are going to be a lot of designers pushing Figma boxes in the future. So working at this higher level, I think, is gonna be more important.

TIFFANY: You're talking about taking something that's super abstract and bringing it in and it's communicating it. How do you communicate it out to people? That's the essence of design. It's making sense of a problem and solving that problem and reorganizing it in a way that solves this problem. So I I think that's a good way of thinking about the future.

It's, fascinating to see how different leaders are staying aware of all of these new things. How do you do things to stay aware of all of the different things that are happening right now?

JORGE ARANGO: I stay aware by doing stuff, taking on personal projects that allow me to stretch my knowledge, my boundaries on this stuff. And I say that kind of as a statement of fact, but also as a reminder to self, because I in the past had the tendency to learn by reading about stuff. And when you learn about stuff by reading about it, you can the primary distinctions, you can learn the models around the space, you can learn the vocabulary, right, you can to talk the talk. But it's very different to think about things in the abstract than actually trying to apply them towards solving some kind of real problem with real tools. And I've, like I said, I've been fascinated by the AI stuff.

I was aware of it before, what was it, November of 2022 when the chat gpt launched. I was aware of what was happening. I had even worked on a few projects in the space, but so many other people. It wasn't until I saw chatgpt that I was like, oh my gosh. That was like the web browser moment.

Right? Like, when I saw the first web browser in the early nineties, I was like, oh my gosh. This is the Internet had been around for a while at that point, but that first web browser really knocked my socks off and chat gpt really knocked my socks off. And

TIFFANY: It's like a user experience. Like, it's a great what do you call it? Alkalade 2 user experience. That is the thing that helped humanity grasp what AI could do. AI has been around for a while.

Right? And the the Yeah.

JORGE ARANGO: Large language models in particular, they were not new in in November of 2022. To your point, the innovation there was grafting a chat UI on it. And when we say UI, it's important to acknowledge that the user interface is only, like, the tangible manifestation of what what is really going on, which is a particular framing for what is happening in this interaction. Right? The framing is you are conversing with something or someone.

Right? Because most of us when we interact through chat, we assume that we that there is an interlocutor on the other end. Right? That choice of user interface really made a big difference in how we not just how we interact with the thing, but how we think about that interaction. And and I'm thinking back to it, like, previously that year, things like DALL E and the journey had come out.

Right? So there was already an inkling, like, something new is happening here and interest. It was pretty clear by the end of 2022 that we were not in Kansas anymore, and I've been experimenting with this stuff ever since. I've written about some of my experiments via my newsletter. I have another experiment that I'm working on right now.

I I am actively experimenting on stuff that I think will have applicability to my clients, my information architecture consulting clients. But I'm starting by using my own writings, my own content as a testing ground before I dare try these techniques on real client work to circle back to the question. It's important to learn in practice, not just in theory. And this means if you're listening and you haven't done so already, get an OpenAI account, pay the $20 a month for the for GPT 4, which is the really good one. And once you are comfortable doing stuff with the chat UI, then start working with the API because it really unlocks capabilities that you can't easily access if you stay limited to the chat UI.

So practice, not just theory.

TIFFANY: I would also recommend those have been incredible tools that you can keep iterating on and even more so if you can unlock the API. We have only seen very much just scratching the surface of what's to come. I'm wondering, you have been pretty successful at turning your idea into a book and putting that out there in the world. What advice can you give aspiring creative people that have ideas about books? Personally, I'm writing some children's books loosely based off of my life.

How should people get into actually publishing a book?

JORGE ARANGO: I think that the most important mental breakthrough for me was the realization that thinking doesn't just happen in the brain. And this is an idea that that a lot of folks have written about. 2 friends of mine, Karl Faust and Steven Anders, wrote a book called Figure It Out, which is about the extended mind theory and how it applies to to design. There's also a really good book called The Extended Mind by Annie Murphy Paul, which is about the subject more generally. But the basic gist of it is that thinking doesn't just happen in the meat computer that we have here on top of the head.

Right? It it actually happens as a kind of evolving situation that happens between your mind, your brain, your nervous system, your senses, your hands, and things in the environment. It could be a whiteboard covered in sticky notes. It could be a legal pad with scribbles for a mind map. It could be Obsidian with an outline that you're typing on there.

Right? All of these things, they are not means for us to record what we are thinking. They are where the thinking is happening. And if you realize that gives you a tremendous advantage when creating anything, because we are fairly limited with the ways we can expand our nervous system, train yourself to pay better attention. You could do up a meditation practice.

There are certain things that you can do, but it's fairly limited, right, barring some chemical or or physical intervention. Right? But our environments are really easy to manipulate. Right? You can close the door and close the shades, and all of a sudden your room changes and your thinking changes in your room, right?

You can visit a stationery store and load up on pens and paper that you really find pleasing. And you start using those and you find that you think different. Right? So these things are not it's not trivial. It is really important to realize that with a little bit of forethought, you can create for yourself environments that let you think.

In the example of a book, all three books that I've worked on, I have created, in my case, digital places that are the place where thinking for the book happens. And you can do that. You can do that kind of thing. Have a place where you record your thoughts, where you record the things you learned through research, where you brainstorm ideas, where you sketch out possible outlines for things. And and don't stress so much about it.

Think of it as, again, an extended an extension of your nervous system, an extension of your sensory apparatus and your cognitive apparatus. Set it up so that it's a place that's supportive of the ways that you work and think. Hopefully, duly noted can help folks with this. This is one of the points of the book is helping you do that. Just know that for me is the baseline is realizing that we think with things, And if you arrange your things carefully, you'll feel better.

TIFFANY: That's awesome. That is inspiring. Jorge, what are you most excited about? I will leave it as a very open ended question.

JORGE ARANGO: I'm very excited right now about having conversations like this one, frankly. I've already talked about my experiments with the AIs and all that stuff, but really, ultimately, the stuff that really gets my juices going is being able to share those experiments with folks. Right? Whether it's in the form of a book or workshops or podcasts like this one. Right?

We went through a period starting about 4 years ago, almost to the day here, where the world went into lockdown because of the pandemic and all that stuff. It was a pretty difficult time for a lot of people. And one of the one of the silver linings that came from this is that it has enabled a different approach to relating to each other. It's made doing what we are doing now, having this remote conversation, much more natural and acceptable just because we were forced to do it for two and a half years or whatever it was. And and I'm very excited to take the opportunity that new modem has enabled to meet with folks like yourself and have these conversations.

So it'd be pretty boring if life ended up being about chatting with AIs. I wanna chat with people. Let's talk about the AIs, but let's talk with people. Right?

TIFFANY: I love the way that you live your life with the freedom that the pandemic brings in that you've moved your whole life somewhere else. So you can do work wherever you are and still maintain connections across the entire globe. I really admire that about you.

JORGE ARANGO: For folks that don't know what you might be referring to, I'm in the process of becoming something of a digital nomad, right, where I pared down my possessions. I'm looking to take full advantage of that. I am we're currently talking. I'm in Panama, which is where I'm originally from, and taking the opportunity to be closer to family. And that does not that I cannot remain connected to the global community of folks who are interested in this stuff like we are doing right now.

This cartoon about the dog surrounded by flames, and it says, this is fine. Right? I think that it's easy for us to become mired in the negativity that is inherent to going through difficult period like the world went through a couple of years ago and in many ways continues to go through. There are a lot of really just awful things happening in the world from wars to climate change, and things are difficult. But there are always positives to things.

And I, I am someone who remains perennially optimistic about the inherent goodness in people and the malleability of people and the ability of people to invent and and find new ways, right? So what we need are people who are willing to find new ways of being, new ways of working, new tech technologies, new tools. And I I don't think I've ever been as excited about working and doing stuff as I am right now, even even amongst all the flames that are burning things around.

TIFFANY: It's also enabling us to be closer to the things that are humanly important. Like you said, being closer to family, being able to connect with people in real tangible ways. I respect that and it's how I want to live my life, right? Is being in connection and relationship with other people. What should everyone be reading or watching right now?

JORGE ARANGO: I've been pretty busy with the beginning of the semester, and that's the case this year as well. So I'm not reading as many. 8. I'm reading a lot for both of those things, for work and for and for teaching. I'm not reading as much for pleasure or for, like, personal growth.

Under regular circumstances, I would say, read more and watch less. So I went to your question is what should people be watching? I would say there are a lot of really good YouTube videos that show you how to do things. These days, most of my watching time is around YouTube and things like tutorials on how to do things. I watch some YouTube for pleasure as well, but I I do not watch much of any, quote, unquote, television or streaming or anything like that.

I'll watch a movie once in a while. But when it comes to reading, I'm increasingly drawn to books that have stood the test of time, Things like Marcus Aurelius, right, Meditations. There are reasons why things like that keep being rediscovered by new generations of humans. And it's been, what, like, 2 2 millennia. Right?

The time serves as a crucible for weeding out the chaff. Right? And this is hard for someone who's just published a book because it's almost saying, don't don't read this book. Go read Marcus Aurelius instead. Kidding aside, if something has stood the test of time, it's because it's proven to be of value to people in a lot of different contexts and in a lot of different societies.

So there's something inherently it that it's because it touches on things that are inherently true and deep in the human psyche. We were talking earlier about, like, connection with other human beings. Right? That's something that's very low level for humans. Right?

And and we can you can work on that. You can work on yourself to make you better at relating with people. And old books, Shakespeare is another example. Right? These are texts that that are still read and are still considered relevant because they are touching on ideas that are universal to human beings.

And and it's really exciting to get a glimpse of what those kind of low level universal values, principles, ideas might be, and then seeing them through the lens of your current context. Things like I I saw the other day you were talking about GPTs. I saw a GPT that was set up to let you ask questions of Marcus Aurelius, which is really interesting. And and it's really interesting too, I think, to revisit these older texts through the lens of our current time and see how they might apply to you and make you a better person.

TIFFANY: Alright. So who should I interview next?

JORGE ARANGO: I was thinking about this. I've mentioned Carl Fast, one of the authors of of Figure It Out. I think that he might be really interesting for you to talk with. I've had 3 conversations with him on my podcast. He is a good friend of mine and a former professor as well.

Someone else who I had recently on my podcast, and now I'm thinking in terms of, like, leadership and more strategic thinking around design, is Nathan Shedrock, who also teaches at the California College of the Arts. And he recently published a book about strategy, which I think might be of interest to folks who are thinking about leadership. So he might be someone else worth interviewing.

TIFFANY: Would you mind connecting us?

JORGE ARANGO: Yeah. I would have no objection at all.

TIFFANY: I wanna thank you wholeheartedly for taking the time to talk to me today. I love getting perspectives from other people, and you are amazing. I encourage everyone to read the duly noted. It already in the first chapter, already gave me great tactical challenges and things that I can input into my daily workflow. Thank you for being here, Jorge.

And I hope that we have more conversations like this in the future.

JORGE ARANGO: Evony, it's been a pleasure. I look forward to talking with you again.
