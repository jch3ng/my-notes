## Transcript

ALEX:

I'm Alex, and I'm not Matt. This is Alex again, and welcome back to the show. Our guest this week is someone who has done a lot of thinking about notes and note taking. Lion Kimbro now works at Pokemon, but he has written chapters in books on note taking as well as his own book entitled "How to make a complete map of every thought you think". I first read his book a couple of years ago and think about it fairly regularly ever since then.

I changed a number of things relating to how I take notes since reading it through it, and I thought getting him to come on the show would be a unique opportunity to talk through some of the practical implications of the various systems he describes as well as just to see how his approach has evolved. 

Matt was unable to make it to the recording as the Internet gods, where he is in Tehran, contrived to make it unworkable. I hope you enjoy the episode nonetheless. 

...

Could you could you say a little bit about yourself and your background to to your work? I mean, you're, somewhat hard to locate on the Internet.

I mean, you have a website, and you can get a sense of some of the kind of previous projects, some coding work, some work relating to wikis, and some some writing, projects. But but beyond that, it's it's a little hard to kind of get the sense of how, the work you've done writing on notes and stuff fits into, to your your kind of broader broader life and and work and so on.

LION KIMBRO: Yes. Okay. So my ... I wrote that book around 2003, 2004, I can't remember exactly when. So I now it's, like, 25. I'm 37 now. So 38 now. So ... I I put that at the beginning. You know, I come out of college and joined the working world, and I wrote that book shortly after. 

So I've had about 10, 15 years since then, and I broadened out immensely. I see it connecting, but it's not a, you know, it was it was the beginning. It wasn't part of some strategic calculated thing.

ALEX: Right.

LION KIMBRO: So, what I've been doing the last 5, 10 years is more in the realm of, community building, spirituality ... I work on creating possibilities in this world. I I want to I am very unhappy with the kind of mainstream world living. I don't ... it's really boring and people are sad and they're have a hard time connecting and they get wrapped up into things that they didn't necessarily want. And I think that and and my my work in building communities and and art and and societies and new possibilities for this world is is all about, you know, helping us be who we wanna be. And in that respect, and I think you can see that if you read my book.

I I think you can see that divergence from the sort of mainstream patterns and mainstream the picture of how life has to be. Right. So that's that I think that's the thread that connects it. I haven't done so much work about I'm very interested in visualization. I'm very interested in education, and I'm very interested in writing.

And so those threads are those threads are still important. I have developed those, but I haven't gone into just the technology of those aspects. I still think there's worlds of possibilities there. I I don't know why we don't pursue that more as a society. For myself, I went more directly into people.

ALEX:

I was wondering if you could just kind of, talk a little to why information architecture and thinking about how we reflect on information and thoughts, How how this is is is is perhaps more important than people give it credit for.

LION KIMBRO:

I I see it as a technology question. It's how how quickly can I learn this thing? How quickly can I use this information? If you every time you go to the store and you forgot that you needed a hammer and they have hammers on sale and you just didn't take the extra 5 steps to get the hammer, You you know, that's that's an information architecture problem anyway. Why is it that my items are not indexed by my location?

Or if you're a programmer, if you're a programmer and you already understand this technology and you need to answer this technical question, search search is nice, but it can be really hard to get the pieces of information that you want, and it's hard it can be hard to keep them local. Like, if you want a piece of information a and piece of information b, and they're both about the same thing more or less, but you have to do 2 different searches to find where those pieces of information were located. You know, if you can keep, you know, locality of reference, is what we call it in the programming world where, like, I I I'm looking if I'm looking for something, the related information should be right nearby. I shouldn't have to do a whole new quest just to find this. You know, so those are all information architecture questions.

ALEX:

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

And so it it to me, it's about, speed, and then there's a qualitative difference that comes with the speed, which is you can get the whole picture. You can be more informed, and you can make better decisions and such. I mean, just looking at it from a purely informational standpoint, I I I I keep dreaming that one day we'll have a schematic Wikipedia. Right now, Wikipedia

ALEX:

What do you mean by that?

LION KIMBRO:

So so information

ALEX:

An index to Wikipedia or

LION KIMBRO:

No. I mean, an actual Wikipedia that is made of schematics. So a schematic is is a so Wikipedia, you know, I call it the forest path. Like, a text. Text is the forest path.

You are following a path from start to end. I mean, we have strategies for skimming and skipping along and such, but there's a narrative structure that goes from point a to point b, and you are following that linear path. Whereas a schematic is more like an architecture like like blueprints for a house.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

And you don't have to read that text from the entry of the house to the bathroom and then back. You know? You know? It's you can your eyes can very quickly index or or or map the globe. You know, if you're looking for Seattle, you can you can find it.

If you're looking for Brussels, you can find it, you know, provide you know the whereabouts of what it is. But and then you can see the related things nearby. And so a schematic Wikipedia would be a visual Wikipedia that had informational schemata of different types for the different kinds of things that you're looking at. And then you can zoom

ALEX:

That sort of thing, you'd you'd have, I don't know, in some kind of virtual reality environment or

LION KIMBRO:

You do it 2 d. There's no reason. I mean, they'd be really cool, but maybe not. 2 d, like like, blue house blueprints, you know, prints, you know, for 2 d. They were great.

ALEX:

Yeah. I mean, it seems it seems that, you know, Wikipedia has links. Right? So you can go through I mean, to some extent, those are your dimensions, your extra extra dimensions. I mean, through kind of hypertext links.

LION KIMBRO:

Yes. That's true. What what what's lacking here is a visual language. Mhmm. And if you had a visual language, you yes.

Links are very helpful, and, yes, they do increase the dimensionality of of your capacity to to see the thing. I mean, I'm thinking let me give an example. There's the Apache web server. Have have you heard of it? Yep.

I I don't know if you'll know. Just in case some listener don't know, a web server is a piece of software. It's, got it's configured so that when someone, you know, httpcolon//blah blah blah slash, look, you know, my path to this document slash, the web browser is the piece that takes that request. I'm looking for this URL, and then it locates the it's configured so that whether it goes to a file or if it goes to a script that generates something or or an image, it knows where everything is and it places it. And programmers have to work on these things all the time, and so you have a lot of questions about how things are configured, about the process where what what does it do.

There's some kind of machinery inside Apache that when it gets the URL, what does it do with it? You know, where does it send it? If I have a problem with it, how do I debug it? Mhmm. And so you can imagine a a a diagram of how the Apache web server works internally.

And if you could oftentimes, it's much easier to trace a diagram than to look through mazes of text to to find the piece that you're looking for and to find the related pieces. So visual if you took a visual map, I I find it far easier to work with a visual map of a system than it is to, read text and paint the visual map in my mind.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

And so we we can save steps, and that that introduces a number of questions of, like, well, what visual metaphors to be used for non intrinsically visual spaces? You know, mind maps are a good example, but there's no kind of standardism there's no standards for mind maps beyond a tree structure that's radially expressed. So I think we need something better than mind maps. I think we need persisting visual metaphors across domains, and I think that it would dramatically increase our access. I here's another piece.

If you think of, like, a newspaper article where they're scribing, oh, there was this poll and there was that poll. You know, I I was I'm I'm following that Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders pulling stuff. Right? And there's this one webcast site that has a map. It has a visual display of time on the x axis, and on the y axis, it has the poll results.

Mhmm. And it has a scatter graph of all the different like, there's been, like, a 100 polls. And so rather than just reading, oh, this pole said that and that pole said that, you can see you have access to, like, a 100 polls on one diagram, and you can you get a much bigger picture, and it's all source attributable. You can click on any of those links, and it'll take you to information about that poll specifically. And so you get a much richer vision and much greater confidence because when you read that thing just like, oh, this poll said that and this poll said that, you wonder if they're cherry picking.

Right? Did they pick a poll that looked good for what they wanted to how they want to slant the presentation? So But, I

ALEX:

mean, if if if if I were to to kind of take that take that a little further then, this this kind of idea of finding visual ways of kind of thinking, I guess, how then would something like fiction fit into that? You know a lot of people prefer or a lot of the things that people like about reading stories is it gives them the opportunity to create those images for themselves, rather than something like film, which they can feel essentially forces you into one kind of fixed configuration.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. I love interactive fiction. There's there's no there's no in schematic, actually, a schematic is usually composed not so much of photographs. Schematic is usually lines, icons, and text. This this usually I mean, you might have a photograph somewhere or not, but I don't see a reason why you can't write fiction in a a schematic form because you you have blocks of text.

Right. I'm now thinking Winston Rometree's subnormality comics, which are almost entirely text. But, yeah. So, I could easily imagine a schematic, fantasy novel. In fact, a lot of them a lot of them like the Lord of the Rings, you go to the back of the book and they have all the family trees.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I think they've been bringing it that way for decades. And, or the CS Lewis, Narnia Chronicles, they have, you know, maps at the beginning of each. And and The Lord of the Rings has the map also. You know? So, what do

ALEX:

you what's your take on the kind of, hypertext fiction movement? It It kind of was active for a while. The kind of the uptake hasn't been what I think

LION KIMBRO:

I don't they thought it would be. I don't think people want, I don't think I think people wanna first have a sense of closure that I read a story.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

You know? Like, I read the whole thing. Like and and, you know, outside, it's not like Rashomon, where you have one story being told from 4 angles. That's the point of the story.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

I think people want to say I read the whole thing. And you could take the Lord of the Rings and just put page indexes on the locations. You know? So, you know, take the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings and just take that map and just put the page number Right. Where that is.

That that would be really cool.

ALEX:

Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

I I wish that fiction came with, indexes. Mhmm. I wish I could look up a character's name and find all the pages that that why don't Well, to some extent, we we

ALEX:

we have that now because, as part of the kind of Amazon, Kindle app, whatever we think of Amazon, they provide this tool called X-ray where you can Oh. Pick out, you you click on that kind of option when you're browsing through a book, and you can pick places. You can pick characters. I think you can pick story story arcs as well, and it will show a visual representation of that story arc and where that thing comes in in the book, and then you can switch between you can just flip between those parts of the story arc. It's called, called X-ray.

And, of course, it depends on the publisher making this available, and someone needs to go and do that indexing work then, first. But it's it's it's there and, yeah, they they do it quite often for, kind of, widely read young adult literature. Yeah. That's that's kinda more and more. I I don't know anyone who really uses it, but it that is there.

LION KIMBRO:

That is really cool to to my mind. I know it's the same reason. Well, yeah, I would love to see character names. I I sort of see this happening in, like so my daughter's playing Final Fantasy 13. Right.

And I I don't have much time for games these days, but I I took the pleasure of of playing it. And I I'm, like, 8 hours into it, so don't ask me questions. But but the you can when you meet a character in the story, they they open up this area, and they say, oh, if you wanna learn about this character, you can read this thing. And so you keep an ongoing dossier of all the characters as you're playing.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And if you want to know about someone, you just, oh, okay. And I I so the the story is following a linear narrative arc. Mhmm. There's no decision where the game goes left or right. But you if you want more information, you can have it.

ALEX:

Yep. I

LION KIMBRO:

that's awesome. I think that's great. And if you wanna play it completion in a completionist way, you can just make sure that you've read all the dossiers.

ALEX:

Yep. Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

Sure. And if you just wanna get from point a to point b, you can do that. Yep. And I I noticed I have difficulty telling my friends that I've read a book because what I mean by reading a book is I've skimmed it. I've looked at parts that were interesting to me and read them in detail, and and that's to me, it's sufficient to say I've read a book.

I have friends here that is not sufficient. They say you don't read books, and I say, oh, okay. I don't I don't read books anymore.

ALEX:

Right. Right. No. The idea that there are very different ways of engaging with what's in a book depending on what your needs for that book are. Going to to to to the book that you wrote, in fact, in, in 2003, I believe, It's very difficult for me to be able to explain this to people, to explain the book to people, who may be listening, in a kind of concise way.

I mean, what do you correct me if I'm kind of summarizing it in in the wrong way. You're you're trying to look at note takings, one of the things we've we've just been talking about, and you've been trying to find a way or a system, or you you do you offer in that book a system for, for people to be able to monitor the kinds of things that they are thinking about. It's kind of paper only idea and system that that that you've developed. Is that roughly correct?

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. I I would further say that it zooms in on creative thought.

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

It it it's focused on ideas. You can monitor your thinking and such. My there's a lot of different things. My my my understanding of thinking has expanded since Right. Sure.

But but, yeah, it focuses I think it folk I would say it focuses in on creative thought or originality or, I ideas. Right.

ALEX:

Do you do you still, do the things that you cancel in the book? I think at some point you said that you would hope to do it for 3 months every 3 to 5 years. Are you still still kind of immersing yourself in this? Yeah. I mean, for those for those who haven't read the book, it's it's a very it seems like a very all kind of encompassing pursuit.

At some point, you know, you say your pen is your life, I think, in the book. And, you know, you're you're you're really writing down every kind of idea and thing that kind of comes into your mind and you're sorting it out as you go through it. Yeah. I mean, it seems like it's not something that you'd be able to do alongside other things to some extent.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. Actually, I've learned ways to do it alongside other things. I I I've changed how I keep notes in a lot. You know? I still I always keep notes.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

And, I there are times where I go more deeply into notes when I need to design something or I am going deep into a question. I will add 3 to 5 years. That sounds that sounds fair. Yeah. I I I will definitely have periods where I say no to the outside world.

I I've got something I've gotta sort out, and I go deep into my thoughts. Yep. And I also and nowadays, I I also more frequently there's an idea that I wanna insert here. You know, it's it's saccading. So the eye when the eye looks at something, we you know, here's a bag of instant oatmeal.

Right?

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I'm I'm I'm I'm looking at it. And when we look at something, we believe that we're just looking straight at it, like we're hitting a a a target, a bull's eye.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

But in fact, our eyes are when when scientists look at people who are looking at things, their eye the person's eye is

ALEX:

Moving all over the place. Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

Yep. Trying your subconscious. Yeah. Yep. And it it looks like you're staying still with something, but you're actually moving around quite a lot.

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

And so when you have a question or especially, like, a question that has meaning or importance to you or or even a technical question maybe, like, you know, why does the speed of light always seem to be the same speed? Your your mind is scanning all around it. Mhmm. And that's how you make contact with the the the question or the the inspiration or the idea. So, I people do this socially too.

And nowadays, I I I spend a lot of time with groups of people. Excuse me. I'm getting a bunch of reminders all the time. The socially, people will get together, and they will ponder something or dialogue about something, and and it's not a completely directed process. Mhmm.

It's not completely like, oh, this is the objective, and now we're gonna put it together. Rather, there's a kind of socializing that happens where people scan it together, and so I do a lot of that today too. Mhmm. I I it may sound off topic, but to me, it's very much on topic. Whether you do it individually or with other people, it's the same process.

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

And that is okay. I forgot exactly what you wanna say. I keep looking this way because I wanna show you pictures from one of my current notebooks.

ALEX:

Uh-huh.

LION KIMBRO:

Can I can I show you Yeah?

ALEX:

Yeah. Sure. We can maybe say maybe include kind of Hi. This is Alex. Just a quick aside, in the middle of the podcast, that follows some discussion which was done over a video Skype connection.

Obviously, there is no video in a podcast, and it was difficult to get the images extracted from the discussion for the purposes of Shonet. So I hope you'll be able to follow along for the next few minutes, as best you can, discussing these these images and get something out of it before we return to the general discussion. Thanks.

LION KIMBRO:

This is like a table of contents, and I argued vigorously against tables of contents Right. In my book. But this says, this is starting with page 1 through 3.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And this is, the table of contents meta. These the red indicates scratch notes.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

That means I'm probably not gonna wanna look at this again in the future.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

The blue, that means it's potentially vague or it it it it's potentially, vaguely interesting to the future. Mhmm. That means that that in the future, I wanna look at the blues before I look at anything red.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I don't care about grocery lists or

ALEX:

or whatnot.

LION KIMBRO:

Here's here's quick key for it. I haven't put much in this notebook. This is kind of a a a fresh notebook.

ALEX:

And the colors are still following the color schematic that you outlined in your book?

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. More or less. Pretty much. Yep. Like, in the book, I say green is for meta.

Yep. And that's exactly

ALEX:

and black for the actual things and red for it.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. So this is, yeah, most of this notebook is empty, so there's really not a whole lot to to show here.

ALEX:

What have you learned since since you wrote since you wrote that book? How how have you changed your approach,

LION KIMBRO:

the Yeah. So the biggest problem with the book is that it's, it's paralyzing. Mhmm. That and it says so.

ALEX:

It Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

It knows so. And that's a huge problem. It's completely unworkable. And a big part of the reason why it's so paralyzing is because, first, the volume Yep. Of everything that's captured.

But second, the integrating. The the the focus on integrating thoughts.

ALEX:

Integrating into life?

LION KIMBRO:

A system. Right. You know, into a map. Right. Into one map of every thought you think.

ALEX:

Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

You really have to construct that map of every thought you think. And then you have to keep it consistent.

ALEX:

I mean, you outline how you do that in the book to some extent.

LION KIMBRO:

Mhmm. Yes. That's that's exactly right. But if we are evolving in our thoughts and if you follow the procedure, you will. There's no question about it.

You will. You're you're what will happen is your whole paradigm will change. That is when you have a significant thought, your organization for your thoughts transforms. Right? So, and something you know, you can you can ask yourself what was important to me to it 10 years ago and ask yourself what's important to you today.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And if you tried to fit your current day understanding into your maps from 10 years ago, it would look extremely weird.

ALEX:

Yep. You need a time dimension or something to that. Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

Exactly. And so, limited integration, limited maps, or limited duration maps are much more useful. Mhmm. And so focusing on the time dimension is is is way more important than I had given credit to when I wrote that book. And so there's a number of practices that I have developed in the last, you know, 10, 15 years, but I've focused on streamlined systems and, temporal closure, keeping it bounded to, like, within 6 to 12 months for a notebook or something like that.

And I focus more on yeah. I I think and so there's the rest is just strategies. I I I could tell you a lot of strategies that have changed, but in terms of the big ideas, it's just what I said. Temporal temporal focusing on the near term construction.

ALEX:

Do you do you see any value to forgetting things? I mean, there there's a kind of particularly towards the end of the book where you you you start talking a little bit about almost the need not to get either overwhelmed or too taken up by the kinds of things that we're writing down at some point. There needs to be a cutoff point to, or at least suddenly you mentioned that in the chapter that you wrote in the My Performance Hacks book, which

LION KIMBRO:

I'll talk about in

ALEX:

a second. But yeah, you know, what's the role of forgetting in, in in in these these strategies and this approach to note taking?

LION KIMBRO:

I I feel like your question already gives the answer. Like, it's like, you want to introduce that yet, but now it's a question. Yeah. Yes. I'm a huge fan of forgetting.

In our social gatherings, there's always an impulse to write things down, you know, for remembering obligations and stuff, but even obligations need to be forgotten after a certain point. Everything gets stale. And the likelihood that you wrote something down in the ideal way is extremely unlikely. You can always perfect something, and, you won't forget the old thing when you look at the the new thing. Yeah.

I I I'm always a passionate advocate for, you know, there there's there's one school of thought which says, oh, we need to sign everything, and we need to write everything down, and we need to put the rules down and stuff like that. And I'm I'm hugely in favor of forgetting the rules. Mhmm. I'm like, we can take a blood oath for something that's important, you know? Yeah.

And for it, did we say 1 month? Did we say 2 months? Did we say 3 months? You know, before you know, how long can someone stay with such and such level of review or whatever? I'm a huge fan of forgetting those rules because it means that when it's time, we go, well, what makes sense now?

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

So

ALEX:

But but, I mean, at the at the same time, you, you have your your theory of notebooks in which you mentioned 3 specific points. The first of which was to reduce repeated thinking and second of which was to prevent lost progress and you have also this quote from Michael Endo we kind of implying, you know, we learn things then we forget then we learn them then we forget. So if we're forgetting things is kind of condemning us to a kind of endless cycle of

LION KIMBRO:

Nope. Nope. Nope. That's not true. Because because we make better forms, and we use it's forgetting in the context of remembering.

Mhmm. Right? We we if you make something really beautiful and then you improve it or you develop something new out of it, you you can forget the old thing, but the new thing is still guiding you. Mhmm. It's still you're still using it to scale the the mountain.

Does that make sense? They're both true. Yep. You know?

ALEX:

Mhmm. Yep. What, would you recommend people develop their own? Would you recommend people adopt other people's short shorthand systems?

LION KIMBRO:

I no. I mean, if you look at someone else's shorthand system, get get whatever ideas you can. Mhmm. You know? But it it's so personal.

It's so situated to your environment.

ALEX:

What what kind of things advantages sorry. Sorry. What kind of advantages does does the Shorthand system bring apart from speed?

LION KIMBRO:

No. That that's it. That's the reason. I I, it gives you speed, and it also allows you to see the structure of of of what you're doing. Right.

So it allows you to think a little more strategically about how do I assemble notes.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

You know, if you're learning a subject and you start developing a terminology, and so for the organization of your thoughts, the shorthand is kind of like your terminology.

ALEX:

Sure.

LION KIMBRO:

But it's all for speed. You know, in a certain respect, everything is always just about the transfer of value and speeding things up from a sort of materials perspective, but it's a useful perspective all the time.

ALEX:

Mhmm. But and the kind of more formal, shorthand systems which, you know, legal secretaries and so on, they use. Would you recommend that over developing your own? No?

LION KIMBRO:

No. No. Greg's script and and, Putnam. They're they're great for what they're for, transcription. Right?

If someone's speaking and you wanna write it down. But if you look you have to decode it in your head. You already have to decode notes anyway. Yeah. So to add another layer to that makes it more opaque.

In fact, when I'm writing, I'll modulate the neatness of the writing based on how much I want my future self to be able to decode it. Right. How important do I think it is for my future self?

ALEX:

Right. That makes sense.

LION KIMBRO:

So I guess you could use it if you thought, oh, this is really not important, but I I wouldn't do it. Yeah. You can drop words like a, then, the, and

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

If you need

ALEX:

to. Are you one of the things which your book introduced me to, when I first read it, however many years ago it was, was the idea of 4 color pens and I have not looked back since then. Are you still using 4 color pens?

LION KIMBRO:

Absolutely. Absolutely. I have the best 4 color pens in the in the world. Here. Oh, I

ALEX:

have not seen that one that type. I have a kind of So

LION KIMBRO:

I did. I did. Right. You haven't. It.

Right? The the big so this is the Sarasa 4. Uh-huh. These these are the best. I I I did this I I did this study, like, 6, 7 years ago of pen.

I I ordered, like, every 4 color pen I

ALEX:

could find.

LION KIMBRO:

I ordered the Tech 9. I ordered, like I went out and and looked for everything. And I tried them all out, and this is the best one. It's the the Sarasa 4. It's zebra Sarasa 4.

Mhmm. The pen is it it it's kind of a thick pen, but it and originally, it kind of bothered me, but I've totally gotten used to it. I don't notice at all. It's a gel ink pen.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

So there's no breaks, no interruptions. It smooths. It's, I forget what it is. It's 0.3 millimeters. So it's got a fine line.

You can get tighter with the Tech Nines, but the Tech Nines, run out of ink really fast.

ALEX:

Okay.

LION KIMBRO:

So it's super annoying. The refills for this are $1 a piece.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

$1 a piece, and I just bought a $100 worth of refills. Right. So and occasionally, I have to order new pens or, you know, if I lose them or or new, new refills, but it's, like, once every 3 years now.

ALEX:

So And I mean, for for for listeners, the idea behind the 4 colors is sort of, almost like you were in a kind of visual shorthand, like we were talking about earlier. It's a way to make it easier for you to pick out certain parts, of the notes. You know, a certain color relates to corrections or things which need actions perhaps or, you know, you can you can adapt those colors to to to however, however you need, really.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. Black is default. Blue is for

ALEX:

When you run out of black.

LION KIMBRO:

No. No. No. No. Although that happens sometimes.

So black and blue are the most common. And if you if you wanna differentiate 2 sections of text, use black for 1, use blue for the other, or use blue for a diagram, then use black for callouts or something like that. Right. The and blue or you use blue for section headers and then black for the text within, and that makes it easier to look at it. Hand handwritten notes are harder to read than typed print.

Using blue and black can help you look at it more quickly. Red is for collection for alerts

ALEX:

or

LION KIMBRO:

corrections, later later addendums, later corrections that substantially alter the meaning of what's being written. I often draw a little flag next to something that I wanna pay attention to later later, or circle something that's really needs to pop out. And green, I use for anything meta Mhmm. For indexing, for saying, oh, see this on this other page, or for a word this is a word that's going to be defined or this is a keyword or something like that. And I I've used that system, and green is also nice for because it's really easy to remove the green text from your field of vision.

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. Green text is nice for, like, something that you wanna able to turn off

ALEX:

from visibility. Right. Right. Right. You mentioned in our kind of emails beforehand, you mentioned indexing as something you've kind of found a lot of value for.

So I don't I've taken a lot of things away from kind of your book. Indexing is not something which I'm really doing with I'm a kind of, yeah, avid notetaker both digitally and, on paper. I think indexing is still something I haven't found a way to kind of build into my system or my life, however you'd like to take that. How would you advise people get started with indexing, and what are the things that one should do with indexing?

LION KIMBRO:

I'm so glad you asked. So you you read a lot of books. I see a bunch of books behind you. Right? Okay.

Do you ever read something and say, oh, I I wanna show this to my friend. Are you okay with writing in your books? Yes. Because Yes. Okay.

Of course. So at the at the very end of the book or at the very front of the book, you just just as you're reading, just put, like, we'll say index, underline it. And then if you're reading something and part of it sticks out like, oh, I wanna share this with my friend Mhmm. Just write your friend's name at the front and put the page number of where the thing is that you wanted to share with him

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

Or her. And instant index.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

And that that that can start you on down this line of, oh, I can get to the things I was reading about. Well, that's pretty cool. Mhmm. So, I I do it too many of the books I read nowadays are technology books. Mhmm.

Django programmers help

ALEX:

Yep. Book or whatever

LION KIMBRO:

it is. So and in those cases, they already have an index.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

But I find that often the index is Poor. Woefully incomplete or strangely not customized to my individual particular needs. Mhmm. Yeah. My my particular project.

I work at Pokemon. You know, there's we have these classes and stuff, and they need different parts of the book. And so I actually put in our custom, you know, this this goes here, this goes there. If you're working on this piece, pay attention to this page. Yep.

And so I'll just add to the index.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And it's fantastic. It's

ALEX:

great. I have, I have, myself the experience had the experience of indexing my own books. I've published 3 books with and one of the books I didn't index myself and, the other 2 I did. And, yeah, while I don't especially enjoy the the kind of making an index a general purpose index for other people for the purpose, you know, there there are I've, yeah, come to see just how vast the differences are between, you know, a well done index versus one which has just been done to tick the boxes of having an index.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. I I like your and I like the x-ray thing. I've gotta look at that. Mhmm. That's I'm a really slow reader, and I read, like, one book a year.

And the reason I'm a slow reader is, I mean, if I'm just skimming something, it's fine, but I I have a limitation. I need to get past this. The so, you know, buyer beware. But I'll oftentimes wanna want to index Mhmm. You know, all the character.

Where are the characters? What color is their eye? You know, like, completely pointless. Right? But I don't index people's eye color in real life.

Why why is this so important in the fictional world?

ALEX:

Uh-huh.

LION KIMBRO:

So I I clearly have a hurdle to get past. But yeah. I do a lot of I

ALEX:

do a lot of my reading in the kind of books behind me aside. I do a lot of reading digitally and then it's a question of importing all of the notes and clippings from my readings, which are then kind of tagged and so on. And that then creates, creates an index of its own. But, yeah, working from paper and working from ideas in real life and kind of having you also mentioned in your email kind of higher level reviews of different types. So I guess what you're talking about is, how to bring together the different things and thoughts you're working on on higher levels.

So it's kind of an index

LION KIMBRO:

the higher levels. Right. What is the purpose of this story? What does this have to do in the larger context? Mhmm.

And, it was just just a useful question Yeah. Regardless. Yeah. But how does this fit into what is the cosmology and how does this fit in?

ALEX:

Mhmm. Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And that's that's a big part of my book, and I I think I went into some detail about how to do that in there.

ALEX:

Yep. Yep. Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I that that's, I just think, useful information. How to organize thoughts visually, I use that all the time Yep. Every day. So there's you know, all of that I think is completely useful today. Mhmm.

ALEX:

Why why do you think that, the kinds of ideas that you talk about in your book, and a lot of them are available and have been kind of talked about in piecemeal form in in kind of other places, certainly kind of visual note taking and so on. This is, yeah, found found in all sorts of places. Why do you think it's not really part of the way that we teach people? The education system.

LION KIMBRO:

I don't know. But I wanna I wanna highlight that question. And I want I'm gonna do it this way. Have you have you ever read, like, a choose your own adventure or a adventure game book or something like that? Okay.

Why didn't that idea appear? I don't know if that's during the eighties or the seventies, but why didn't that idea appear until the eighties or seventies? I mean, like, what prevented people

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

500 years ago from doing that?

ALEX:

What what's yours? And what's your guess?

LION KIMBRO:

My my theory is that it was computers. Mhmm. My my belief is that people started creating computer games

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

And interactive fiction. And then someone realized, oh, we could you know, it's kinda like the technology went had to go forward in order to go back.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I I I I it has to do with the spread of the idea

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

I think. And I think that the computer made the idea really visible, and then people realized, oh, we could have been doing this. I mean, but there's no reason they could have been doing this a 1000 years ago.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I don't I don't know. I don't know what it is. I have no real good answer.

ALEX:

Alright.

LION KIMBRO:

It's it really that question interests me a lot. Mhmm. But

ALEX:

I'm sure I'm sure that to to some extent it has to do with, the kind of commercial viability of pen and paper?

LION KIMBRO:

Yes. I yeah. There's

ALEX:

I mean, no one makes money off that.

LION KIMBRO:

You're right. No. I I mean, it sounds silly, but I think that is a huge piece of it. Because we could really I mean, I don't see any reason why there couldn't be, just in in in in terms of physics. I'm not trying taking the economy into question.

It it stands clear. But there's no reason why you couldn't take a 100 math professors and have them write the ultimate study how do you teach linear algebra for 10 years and and really dramatically reduce that. In fact, during World War 2, electronics, they needed, tens of thousands, 100 of thousands, I I don't know how many, but a huge number of people who were skilled with electronics, who understood electronics. And the Navy found these 2 or 3 guys, like Niugen or and they produced this highly visual, really amazing, series of books on elementary electronics. There's there's not not 3 pages happen, pass by, where you do not get a schematic or a diagram or a visual metaphor and very bare on text, very rich in graphic, in in in, icon and schematic and and equation.

And, you know, pictures of people with soldering irons and stuff like that and Mhmm. You're really explaining electricity. And to my thinking that I've never seen a book since that focused so deeply on how can we get this information across as quickly as possible. Right. And I I think you could do even even better today, but it's just lack of vision.

Right. That's it. Whereas in World War 2, they, like, had a need. Yes. And they were like, okay.

We're gonna do this. We're gonna focus just how do you teach them as quick as possible. That did it.

ALEX:

Yeah. In your book, you essentially say on the use on kind of finding digital ways to do this, you essentially say we're not quite there yet, the software isn't there, the interface isn't there. There are some ways that maybe we could do this in the future, but there's nothing around at the moment which allows me to do this. You just showed me your pen and paper written books still, which indicates to me that you still haven't found that digital interface and solution? Or what would what would be your recommendations for people who, for for whatever reason, need to kind of remain in a digital environment or or so on?

LION KIMBRO:

Take the ideas on indexing. Indexes are super easy to maintain on a computer. Mhmm. They're way easier to maintain on a computer than they are on on paper. Mhmm.

I use computers for indexing my work notes. So what I do is I uniquely number every page of my notes at work, and then I keep an index on my computer. And my coworkers are often amazed. They'll say, Brian, do you know about this? I know it's been 2 years since you worked on it.

I said, let me look that up. And then, like, 2 minutes later, got my pages, you know. So and they're always, like, wow. That's Right. Amazing.

Now I have really detailed notes on the functions or or whatever it is. So use your computer to index. Mhmm. And if you need to and and, like, the sheer volume of text in and out at work is is huge. And so I do I I keep a giant file full of all my and and I'll use I'll use in my I have a shorthand.

It's a little paper clip icon.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I'll draw a little paper clip icon, and I'll put a number of a note on the computer. Right. You know, in in that way I don't have to, like, oftentimes, I have these long file paths with, like, a 100 characters in them. Right? And so and and I'm gonna have to type it out eventually.

Right? So I just I keep that in the computer, and I put a little paper clip, you know, 237, you know, and then I go to 237 on the computer and just copy and paste. Mhmm. Right. I also like, like link shortcutting.

ALEX:

Okay.

LION KIMBRO:

You know, tiny URL. Right. And I have a note shorthand notation. It's a t with a rectangle around it.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And that means tiny URL.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And so if I put tinyurl blah blah, I go to blah blah. And also, I don't think most people know this, but in tinyurl, you can, you can specify a word. You you can specify your

ALEX:

Oh, yeah. Sure. Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

Link text for it. And so I'm amazed how often

ALEX:

Are you do you do you have any concern that at some point, maybe tiny URL goes defunct and then you no longer have access to those links?

LION KIMBRO:

No. Because they made a consortium with tinyurl and bitly, I think, and Okay. The bunch of them. They made a a consortium for protecting that information.

ALEX:

Okay. Great.

LION KIMBRO:

So if if if if you do lose it, you can they're gonna store it somewhere and get it back.

ALEX:

Right. Yeah. Do you have any, thoughts or experience or practical ideas about collaborative note taking, collaborative information sharing. I do a lot of my projects, and a lot of our listeners often have to work in teams with people, sharing information and so on. I have yet I I know you have kind of worked on wikis, and you you kind of have have written about that.

Is that something you'd recommend? It's it's not something I've ever done. Yeah. Is is that the way to do that?

LION KIMBRO:

It depends on what kind of work you're doing. In terms of community wiki.org, I made a huge investment in, and it was deeply rewarding for me and deeply rewarding for us for a period of, like, 5 years. We had a deep resonance, and it was really cool. But that's a particular kind of, that's a particular kind of work. It was theory building is our name for it.

You can look up that phrase on CommunityWiki, where you're developing a sense of the world, a sense of things and you develop a link language and stuff. But in general I think I prefer, using dropbox and text files.

ALEX:

Okay. Just simply

LION KIMBRO:

You use Dropbox, keep a bunch of text files, keep your text editor use a text editor like Emax. Yep. No. Just Emax. Use Emax and Dropbox and edit files in there, and you'll get a little notice whenever one of the file changes.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

And you can edit yourself. There's some problems with that if there's if you and your friend are overwriting each other. Right. In which case, it it remains an open problem. There there used to be a there was a there was a a rash of, really cool There was time in Moon Edit and Wave, and there was a lot of work on real time textual collaboration.

Mhmm. And this is kind of evaporated. I don't I don't know exactly why. But

ALEX:

To some extent, the kind of, Xanadu project was also trying to address that. And I mean, a lot of that that whole kind of Yeah. That whole story is about, how they went so far down that that rabbit hole trying to trying to solve that problem.

LION KIMBRO:

I mean, basically, we just need text editors and there's there's something I wanna say. Our our time is almost up. Yep. I'm conscious of that. The new Apple Pro

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

I am very excited about. It may be unwarranted. But the biggest problem so there's 2 problems with using pens on computers, and the first is resolution

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

Which is a problem that Apple has solved, with their super high DPI screens and such. The second and the killer is latency.

ALEX:

Yep. And latency for listeners is essentially the lag between when you're moving the pen and the thing appearing on the screen. Right?

LION KIMBRO:

Right. And people say, oh, that's no problem or I don't notice it, but then I notice that they're not keeping their notes on the computer. You draw the left side of the capital a, and by the time you're trying to draw the cross hatch, it hasn't even appeared yet. Yep. There's no it doesn't it doesn't work.

It's just it's just broken. Yeah. It's it's just broken. Yeah. And I've long known for, like, a decade I've been aware that the the pen interface is missed out on the mouse.

The mouse was introduced at a time like, the mouse has a dedicated IRQ. Yeah. It's at a hardware level, it interrupts the whole computer to to get its request in, and it goes straight through the kernel and straight to whatever program needs to use it. And that's why when you move your mouse, it moves immediately. There's extremely small latency.

And I've often thought and and pens, though, are usually going through USB. They're usually going through layers of software, interpretation, and stuff like that. So I've thought that if there was going to be a company that was going to solve this, it would be Apple because they still maintain complete vertical integration from hardware to software to, you know, user interface. So, I'm very excited. I wanna see if their pro works.

And if it does, I I'm right there. Right. And then I'm gonna become an iOS developer and make my own note keeping system, whatever. That's that's my big hope. We'll see.

ALEX:

Just kind of a couple more questions before we move to kind of your your picks. In your book, you mentioned your enthusiasm for David Allen's GCD or Getting Things Done system of essentially understanding tasks on with also the dimension of the particular context in which the task can or can take place. I also kind of share that but for kind of information workers I'm not entirely sure that the system is the complete solution. Do you have any any thoughts on that?

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. I I I am skeptical about it. Today, I I like the genre of thinking. I like I like trying to figure out how to be more productive with tools, which has limits, which I think is really important. Personality, character, attention, drama from life, you know, there's a million things that, effect there are more there, I think, are more important than tools.

Yep. But I I do appreciate that that tools are important. And I think the greatest limitation, I think, of Alan's someday maybes can just if your mind and world are structured in such a way that his system clearly works for him But for me, it didn't work. Just didn't work. And I had some limited with it, but it was just that it was limited.

And I do far more thinking, and it it doesn't really

ALEX:

So how do you currently manage things?

LION KIMBRO:

Artists, I don't think GTD would work for you. Or you know what I mean? Yeah. For certain for a bureau for for a a bureaucracy, I I can totally see it working.

ALEX:

Yeah. How do you split paint a painting into all of the different steps that one would do to paint a painting? Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. It didn't don't really make sense.

ALEX:

Right.

LION KIMBRO:

So it's for a particular niche, and I appreciate it within that niche, but I haven't thought about much since then.

ALEX:

Mhmm. Mhmm. So what what what works for you?

LION KIMBRO:

What works for me? In terms of general productivity?

ALEX:

Task task management productivity.

LION KIMBRO:

Right right now, well, Jira Jira is

ALEX:

What's that?

LION KIMBRO:

A task manager Uh-huh. By Atlassian, I think. Okay. And it's, a ticketing system. So ticketing systems work fantastic, for the kind of work where I do where there's 2,000 issues, 50 are immediately relevant.

You have a team of people working on them. That's what we use. It works great. Kanban is a system that

ALEX:

Oh, sure. Kanban. Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

Kanban. Yeah. I found I like that system.

ALEX:

A lot a lot to kinda benefit from that. Yeah.

LION KIMBRO:

Yeah. And and with teams of people, keeping things up in the air verbally is, I think, remarkably effective. Right. And then you can have someone with a calendar you have one person who keeps the calendar Mhmm. And stuff like that, and make sure that dates are scheduled and retrieved.

So groups of people can do amazing things.

ALEX:

So then to kind of close out, we normally ask guests to kind of pick a few things that they would like or be kind of interested other people to take a look at, maybe they haven't heard of, what book did you did you have to to reference to our audience?

LION KIMBRO:

So I I this is almost a religious point. This is almost like recommending the Bible to people. But there's a book that I want people to know about, and very few people know about. So it's called Dying to Learn. Mhmm.

It's by Oberto Airati. Mhmm. He was the founder of Dominoher Mhmm. Which nobody's heard of of in Italy. And if you think about the problems of our day, you know, everything from global catastrophe to, you know, climate catastrophe to to war to, all the way to depression and loneliness and inability to connect and purposelessness.

You know, take that whole spectrum. The Dominarians have really created something admirable. They're a 1,000 people. They've made this extraordinary eco community society. Their lives are radically fun.

They've had a fully functioning alternative currency for, like, 20, 30 years. Mhmm. They grow a lot of their own food. They, I had pig there once. The pig I I was feeding it the day before.

You know? It's, like, right outside. They and their their way of life is so fun and creative. And it was exactly the kind of world that, you know, we when we vision the future, it's this really inclusive, magical environment. Or, like, Patrick Farley is really good at explaining this.

Patrick Farley wrote e sheet, electric sheet. Mhmm. And he makes a a a comment called the guy almost what was, which was hugely influential for me. I I I loved it, and I encourage everybody to read it, especially anyone in technology. I think it should be standard reading for technologists.

Mhmm. The guy I almost was, in in some ways about the birth of the web. But, we always envision these inclusive, magical futures where ideas, you plant them at the ground. They they grow up into into reality. And Damanhur has created a system of life that's about that.

Mhmm. And the book Dying to Learn is I I I visited their place to see how does how did that happen. Like, I was imagining, like, documents about the rights of man or, you know, something or or or planning documents about here's what we're gonna build and how we're gonna build it. And what I found instead was, poetry. That's not to say that the book is poetry, but it's definitely poetic.

And it is, really beau very romantic and very beautiful. And so I just want people to read that book and hear about it and know about it, talk about it.

ALEX:

Wonderful. I

LION KIMBRO:

know I haven't been to Domino's in 8 years, but, 7 or 8 years. But this book had left a huge impact on me, and I regular I reference it at least every 3 months. I I open it up and reread it, and it's covered in it's covered in all blue and red and ink. And blue means I agree with this, and red means I disagree

ALEX:

with this.

LION KIMBRO:

But, like, I I really think a lot about what's in that book Mhmm. In it. So

ALEX:

Great. Thank

LION KIMBRO:

you. And did you did

ALEX:

you think of a film?

LION KIMBRO:

I had a hard time with the film. Or it could

ALEX:

be, you know, some guests have have changed that into a computer game or some something else like that, some kind of

LION KIMBRO:

Oh, you know, can I so I just saw my daughter showed me this thing? It it it was and I was blown away by it. It and it it sounds totally dumb. Let me let me the name, I I I keep forgetting because it's a crazy name. So it's an anime.

There's 13 okay. It's called Puella magi madoka magica.

ALEX:

Okay.

LION KIMBRO:

Okay. Puella magi madoka magica. And it frames itself as a, what do you call it, like, magical girl magical girl anime, like Sailor Moon or something like that. Totally boring to me. Not interested at all.

But but 2 of my friends, Max Davis and, my daughter, Silver, were adamant her name is Sakura in the book. She changed her name to Silver. Are adamant that I would like this.

ALEX:

Yep.

LION KIMBRO:

And I saw it, and I was blown away. It is, it's it's it it is not I mean, yeah, on the surface is a magical girl anime, but it it does not follow the tropes at all. And it's about this girl. She meets, this creature, this, you know, it's this cute white fluffy thing. Right?

But it's like, okay. Give you'll make a contract with me, and I will give you you I will grant you a wish. And in return, you will become a magical girl, and you will fight witches.

ALEX:

Mhmm.

LION KIMBRO:

The witches are utterly deranged. It is very dark, very, very creepy. And it starts so it starts with that kind of, you know, anarchist, yeah, fuck the system kind of glee. They took but but it goes into really deep places. It goes I I I felt like I was doing the the malakirti sutras.

Right? Like, it it it goes and and, oh, it's just it's profound. It's it's amazing, and it's profound. And, you you have to have a tolerance for for darkness to to watch it. It goes really deep into, grief and, but not in a not a silly way.

And Gratuitous way. I don't not in a gratuitous way. It's it's really and it has a really powerful, cosmic vision, which I just oh, it's so amazing.

ALEX:

I will definitely check that out. You sold me.

LION KIMBRO:

Okay. Yeah. It's it's it's it's, well, then send me I know you you're busy, but send me an email at least telling me what you thought. I'd I'd love to hear to hear this.

ALEX:

And finally, a song, potentially. Don't know if you're a music person or not.

LION KIMBRO:

Bohemian Rhapsody. Or, a wish from the final from from the, Secret of Mana soundtrack. There. There's some somewhat obscure. Or the, yeah.

I like Chiptune. Nobody's gonna like that. There you go.

ALEX:

Perfect. Thank you so much for for taking the time to to to talk to us.

LION KIMBRO:

I know you're, kind of busy person. This was, kind of a long time in the making in some ways but yeah I'm sure our audience will take a lot away from from from this and

ALEX:

I hope many of them kind of go and check out your book there's a lot of things in there that that that could could benefit people, I think.

LION KIMBRO:

It's a great pleasure talking with you. Thank you. An honor.
