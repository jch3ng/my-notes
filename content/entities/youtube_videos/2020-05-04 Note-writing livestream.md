## Transcript

I'm just gonna make sure this actually appears to be live. And then I'm mostly going to ignore this Twitch channel henceforth because I don't really know how to do kind of, like, a live trapeze active thinking and figuring things out while, people are talking at me. Okay. This seems to, this seems to be working. Great.

Good morning. Hope you all had a good weekend. I'm now mostly going to pretend that you don't exist, except that I'm going to kind of talk aloud and explain, what what I'm doing. I'm gonna narrate a little more than otherwise would in my work, just to kick things off. For this latter part of my writing session this morning, I want to think about these books design and bound.

These books by, Anne Pendleton Julian and John Silly Brown. And Pendleton Julian is a architect at MIT, but just more generally is, a designer. And, I have a lot to say about design. John Seeley Brown was the chief scientist at Xerox PARC and, has kind of a a legendary history in the creation of various personal computing technologies. These books have some very unusual ideas about design.

I find them quite profound in in a number of ways, and yet there are some tensions with my views on design or my hunches about design, and I want to try to understand these tensions. And I think I'm going to try to write to the authors. But in order to write to the authors, I need to understand the work a lot better. So this is me trying to understand the work better and, trying to understand how it relates to my own ideas about design, and in particular, to try to articulate tensions, contradictions I see. Just questions even.

And, bash is ask asking for my permission to access some accessibility features here. Made a change to a script right before this call. Probably not the best idea. Hopefully, everything doesn't burn down. Okay.

Just making sure things seem to be functioning here. They do seem to be functioning here. Alright. Good, I guess. Let's get going.

So I tend to begin with, a note that's centered on, the day. This is this is an ephemeral note. This is something that gets thrown away, basically, never consulted again, but it's sort of a staging area. So some of the the key things that that are, sources of conflict for me, are the ideas that I've been developing with Michael Nielsen around this theory of insight through making. And there there's kind of a a core parable that we tell about insight through making, which is that the invention of the Hindu Arabic numeral system required a work of mathematical genius simultaneously with the work of design genius.

Now that's intention and sort of in agreement with a number of themes in these books, Design Unbound. And I don't really understand the places of tension and agreement at the moment. All I can really perceive is just a textured relationship with places of overlap and places of disjoint, relation. So I need to understand them better. Design and bound claims some things relative to this.

First, maybe most relevantly and shallowly, there's, various claims in the traditional design practice sense, and I'll say, like, human centered design practice sense around, like, collaborative participatory design, reframed, using a a term of art or coinage, systems of action. Systems of action don't just comprise, like, things which are designed which are designed collaboratively or in a participatory fashion. But that's an element of systems of action. So I'm pretty sure that, systems of action is going to be one of the pages that I write. So we can we can start there.

I don't really know I don't know that I'm gonna start there. Instead, I'm just gonna bring it up a little more. And for a coinage like this that's just really vague or vague isn't the right word. It's very general. I usually title the note something like something like this to kind of scope it.

Alright. So besides systems of action, another key piece of intention here is the author's own claims about the importance of essentially, like, authorial, leadership. In particular, there's a claim that, designers must act, as both leaders and facilitators. And there's some very specific text that I will kind of excerpt and distill that explains how yeah. While collaboration is an exalted activity, most truly great works are the result of 1 person, either acting alone in their studio or as creative leaders capable of transferring their vision to others.

A bunch of examples listed, Rodin, Calder, Eisenstein, Kurosawa, Wagner, etcetera, and those great works have come from one creative mind. This resonates, and yet it's in tension. Right? It's in really essential tension. They use even a better word than leader here.

They use the word orchestrators. Great work does seem to basically always come from one mind or sometimes like a hive mind, a duo. And yet that duo must be in contact with be working in working on, this broader environment. So that accesses some of the central themes of this book. They're all kind of entangled, but the book returns again and again to this phrase, in a white water world, doing x in a white world water world, designing, thinking, creating, etcetera, in a white water world.

What's meant by that is that, we live in a world in which the contexts for which we are designing, they're constantly evolving. There is no, like, fixed list of design requirements ever. This accesses the expanding the brief coinage, from the book, which kinda relates to the traditional or or more jovial, design saying of, rip the brief. So it's it's much more serious in this context, and it it means something much more specific. Yeah.

In a white water world, there's no fixed list of design requirements. Rather, in a sailboat, you can, set, set off towards the horizon, tack with the winds, but always keep your objective in scope. But when whitewater rafting, you really need to dance with the river, use your paddles both to steer and also to feel, the the weight, and the movement of the water. There's no fixed destination possible. You're riding with the current, yet you are the current.

So I'll unpack this in a whitewater world thing into its own notes as well. This is very important to the central themes here. And it's also important to these claims about insight you're making, but in kind of a peripheral way. There's also this really central related theme about, designing in and on a context. Now what's meant by that is that when you're designing, you are designing within a context.

I e, you're you're maybe making an object or creating a system, which acts on the objects, and the parameters of that context. And yet when you do that, almost inevitably, if you're doing anything interesting, you're also acting on the context in which you reside, changing its parameters, changing its goals, changing the core nouns and verbs to use a phrase from my work with Michael. So the tension here and and there's there's one other core piece that I'm gonna need to draw on, which is, well, I guess it gets back to the authorial versus, yeah, the authorial. Okay. So there's there's a specific story, or series of stories, really, which are roughly the normal kinds of stories you see in high level design portfolios.

We co created a solution with 300 domain experts, you know, with within research libraries is one example and within, the design of a, a university for women in Southeast Asia is another. And the attention here is that, the designers are not experts on libraries. So they're able to distill the needs, observations, etcetera, of the experts. And they're also able to facilitate, the experts, like, expressing and thinking more creatively than they otherwise would. And they're also able to do a bunch of, synthetic and even some abductive thinking themselves.

And here's here's where I think the core tension is that seems not sufficiently acknowledged in this book and kinda accesses the the core claims that Michael and I make with insight through making in the Hindu Arabic numerals parable. And that's that so the designers are able to do a bunch of synthetic, not adductive, but abductive, thinking themselves. But this activity is ultimately limited by the designer's understanding of the domain. Isn't it? This this is the tension that this this gets to the the jab at IDEO in the, Hindu Arabic numerals parable.

So the designers might be good synthesis, but they don't really understand the domain they're synthesizing. They have a couple of months exposure to it, So is it possible and and all of this just it sits in conflict with this claim about leadership. You know, the people cited here are Dante, Cervantes, Joyce, Bach, Wagner, Cage, Borromini, Geary, Miro, Calder, Eisenstein, etcetera. Not in all cases. And it's interesting that, like, for instance, maybe not a domain expert in all the systems he's designing for, and maybe that's actually why he should explain some of his failures.

But these others are both they play both the role of the synthesis and the domain expert. So, like, Bach, Wagner, certainly Miro, Radana, Kurosawa. They're both the experts in the design wise synthesis and also in the domain of inquiry, whatever it might be. You know, artistic expression and box case, I mean, he's a he's a spiritual leader. He devotes his life to, studying spiritual music and spiritual texts, and that's what he's expressing through his music.

Some interesting contrast with, in particular. He's somewhat notorious for not understanding, the object level domain issues that he's designing around. But, anyway, all of this is in serious tension with these IDO ish stories about synthesizing and distilling domain knowledge from, you know, university research administrators. The university research administrators know a bunch of things about the needs of libraries, but, they mostly lack, say, the, the structured creative skills that the designers have as as well as the the skills of system design that the designers have, at least to some degree. And the designers have those skills, but, they don't deeply understand libraries.

And I don't know how you get Wagner or Monroe out of that. And in particular, I don't know how you get Hindu Arabic numerals out of that. So I think that's the core tension. And maybe now I can articulate that, and we can get to, to the meat of this process after 15 minutes of kinda organizing thoughts. I think that's the core tension.

This book argues that creating systems of action, which is a term of art, but you can also just interpret it in its, like, colloquial vernacular denotation. Creating systems of action requires experts in actually, they even make this case themselves. Yeah. Reading context deeply and generating highly amplified understandings of contexts, that is a core designer skill. That's I I think any serious design people would agree with that.

That's that's not really a contentious claim from this book. So we could look at that as as kind of just a core activity of designers. And yet, those people are rarely, the people, who are contending with the system to be designed on a daily basis, and who have deep expertise in the domain of design. They're not, university library, administrators. The best work seems to come from, like, come ultimately from one person.

That one person might be synthesizing a bunch of other people, and, of course, they're they're extremely dependent on the context in which they're working. But the work ultimately comes usually from one person or sometimes a dyad, like, the aims. In all the examples given and in all the examples I can think of, that person is a profound domain expert as well as a meta level expert, whatever that means. So, you know, if if they're if they're Monroe or or Redondo or whatever, like, he's a profound expert of human physiology, and yet also an expert at these meta level skills of seeing, the skill of an artist. So, aren't these observations incompatible?

Where how do we get, Wagner level work on university library system design? I guess that's the core of the question. Normally, at this point, I would take a break because I've been at my computer for 40 minutes, but I'm just gonna chug on through for the purposes of this live through livestream. We'll see how that goes. Alright.

So I I think I have my hands around, a first draft of this core tension enough to start developing the main ideas. So I'm gonna I'm gonna do that. First thing I find myself wanting to do is to create a note just for the book. Usually, I do kind of a reverse naming. This is what I would call a literature note.

This is not gonna be a a note that really stands on its own. It's not evergreen. Instead, it's just gonna be kind of a jumping off point. I would like to have a bibliography. It's really a book series, and I'm using the tarot here.

This is a book of 2 volumes. It's a little unusual, and it was published in Boston by MIT Press in, relatively recently. Okay. What are you doing, Zutero? Come on.

Alright. That will do for now. Yeah. That'll do for now. Okay.

Alright. So I think I'll begin by trying to articulate systems of action as they express in this book. I don't really like this style of note, the the coinage after someone else. And part of why I don't like it is that it means that I'm still thinking in terms of this other person's systems and frameworks rather than kind of essentially in terms of. It's like I haven't fully digested it.

But some terms, like, deliberate practice or whatever, like, they're they kinda transcend the book. I'm not really sure if systems of action transcends this book yet. So we're gonna start here with, kind of a coinage oriented note, and we're gonna see we're gonna see whether we can process this into something that isn't kinda dependent on the authors. Alright. First, just a a high level summary of the book, design and bound.

This is kind of a poor high level summary, but, it helps me ground my thinking about the book. And it's also, like it generates a little bit of feedback about how well I feel I understand this, I don't know, 900 pages from a high level. Alright. Systems of action. Let's talk about systems of action.

This book, by the way, the reason I originally picked it up was that, it has just an incredible table of contents. I know that's a really shallow reason to pick up a book, but, it's it's really amazing. And, I think I think it was David Chapman who originally showed this to me, and I think it was when I was talking about peripheral vision. And I kinda thought, you know, any book that, any book that has a table of contents that looks like this has to be pretty interesting. And then I saw that, John C.

Lee Brown was one of the authors, and I thought, well, okay. Definitely gonna read this now. It's interesting because I I wasn't, wasn't familiar with Anne Pendleton Gillian. The book actually seems to be mostly written in her voice, rather than John's. And, she has a lot of really profound things to say.

Clearly, a very, very interesting practice. Alright. Slowly navigating to systems of action. Okay. And I'm trying to put this in my own words.

I'm trying, like, not to copy what the book has to say. Let's see how that matches up with their definition. A system of action is a coherent collection of interrelated components that affect the way people do things. K. It's transformative in intent affecting both explicit behaviors and embedded habits.

Systems of action scale enabling small actions to affect a large social ecosystem through work they do inside the system. Alright. So there's a few important elements there that I missed. Again, trying to paraphrase without looking at the book. Systems of action are constructed to allow participants to affect substantial change through small actions, and indeed don't necessarily require the participation of, all, inhabitants to generate that change.

That's pretty good. Coherent collection of interrelated components is an interesting phrase. It's very vague. Says this. I think we're just gonna have to drill down.

I will use that for now. Although I don't really understand what it means, so I'm going to put it in quotes. That limits the fact that this is not my voice. I don't really understand this quote. Why am I writing this note?

I'm writing this note because, of this core tension. Yeah. And what I really wanna access is, I'll articulate some of the the key components of the system of action. I'm gonna begin by transcribing the list from the book or at least a paraphrase version of list from the book, and I'm gonna try to unpack each of these myself. That's fine, actually.

Alright. This vehicle notion is is, I think, really entangled to the authors and particularly Pendleton Julian's work as a studio designer. Like, the nature of her work is that she takes on engagements with, you know, a research library or whatever. So she needs a vehicle. Vehicle's an opportunity.

A contract with a research library, redesign plan, a brief around the construction of a university. Really, this is sufficient. Concept. The concept grounds the vision and the action. Sorry.

In in the vehicle. It's more concrete. It's more specific. It doesn't fall to the level of specific mechanisms, but it, describes how the vision is going to be achieved by the vehicle. The mechanisms are, specific system nouns and verbs.

Again, not really using her phrasing. So this might be, in a a physical environment. This might, represent physical spaces or affordances in a social environment. This might capture, rituals or practices. Yeah.

I think I've mostly captured what's being described here. Is there a coherent set strategically chosen to balance and amplify each other? The system of action operates in a in ever changing context. That context, level of the individual, small groups, communities, and, the larger society in which that design is embedded, the relationships It's not a great first crack, but it'll do. So this is what we're what we're designing when we're designing a system of action like a a new library system.

And here again, I'm just gonna transcribe these necessary practices and components and then think about them a bit more. Amplified reading of context, I think, is gonna be the most important one for us. This is a very designerely competency. Shaping and working in extremely multidisciplinary spaces. I think this is mostly necessary because, the authors and their peers are consultants.

If it were really the case that the library administrators had the core competencies to pull this off for themselves, like, they would still have to be somewhat multidisciplinary because, there are many disciplines involved in libraries, but they wouldn't need to be these, like, hubs that designers do. Meta designing. I don't think I even recall what that is. I think it's only discussed in a footnote. Okay.

And this is gonna be the other one. Embracing the role of the designer as both leader and orchestrator. This is gonna be the other key thing. Alright. Shaping critical and effective works of partners.

Alright. I don't actually understand what meta designing is. Let me I think it's just been a footnote. Maybe it's not even in a footnote. Maybe that's why I didn't, Yeah.

Oh, no. No. The whole the whole chapter is okay. Yes. Yes.

Yes. Alright. So meta designing is, about designing the design processes. Again, maybe only only so important because the authors are consultants. I am I think meta designing is a this may represent.

And by the way, this this note lives in my inbox because it that this note is not yet, evergreen, hashtag e for evergreen. It's got these, like, crappy highlighted bits, and this note can't stand on its own. So, yeah. Okay. This meta designing, it's something you need Meta designing is important to the traditional studio design process because the studio designers are outside the context of use and they have to create some way to bring the people who are inside of the context of use, together with their design process.

But, like, wouldn't it be nice if that weren't so necessary? Just wanna make sure everything's still working with the stream. Seems to be. Alright. Good.

I'm just hoping that stays that way. Alright. So I think these two highlighted guys are gonna be the key ideas. And here again, embracing the role of the designer as leader and orchestrator, this probably wants to be in some note. I'm not gonna frame it in their terms.

So it may be several notes. I don't really know what they are yet. This relates to the observation about truly great works and getting the results of 1 person. But first, let me try to articulate, the author's claims here. The designer's role is both to, distill the many ideas and observations from the Charettes, the converse oh, gosh.

What's the word? The conversations with disciplinary experts, etcetera, and also to, turn that into a vision of their own. This is really the core of the issue, I think. Just bringing some pulls from the book. So I'm not totally sure what I wanna do here.

And usually my response to this is to ask, what can I say? What is a simple thing that I can say that seems to work or seems to be true? Are there 2? Do we have a sync conflict or something? Yep.

Alright. Good about it. Think I'm gonna bounce over to insight you're making. I'm spending too much time in others' words. I wanna ground myself a little more in my own.

Yeah. Action through making is a core idea of this book as well. This note is really saying several things at once. It's making a claim about, work needing to be situated in the context of action, this kind of dynamic dance. There's a distinction, that I'm gonna have to develop because it's interesting Between our theory here and what's articulated in this book, namely that's, this theory suggests that what's happening when you are making things and thinking hard about what you're making and using them to get new ideas is that you're you're making a thing and putting it out in the world and using it to see the world better.

And the authors of design and bound would suggest that, yes, that's true. And in addition to that, you are also changing the world, by putting that thing out there, and the world is just constantly changing. So, this is a loop that's necessary, not only in order to correctly see what you are making, but it's just necessary in general in a so called white water world. And the second claim is really the central one to my current confusion, which is just that, yeah, Hindu Arabic numerals would not come out of a design consultancy. I'm gonna unpack that a little bit.

K. I'm gonna refactor this note a little bit. This is starting to access the conflict a little more sharply. And I noticed that I'm I'm actually writing this differently than we had in TTFT. I'm bringing more design process into it, to try to make it stand up better against, what design and bound has to say.

I'm actually, in some sense of, like, steel manning that's, it's not quite true. It's partially true. But in particular, bringing them into the design process is not something we discussed in TTFT. The thing is that it just it still wouldn't work, I think. The core problem is that it's a good way to start a a paragraph if you wanna see if you actually know what you're talking about.

Alright. Now for the so what. So what is something like, It's like a little too sharp, which is not quite right. Not quite sure what I think here. This phrase insight you're making, it's interesting.

It's it's kind of the coinage has drifted. Trying to bring it over here. Yeah. This phrase is very important. Yeah.

There's a separate claim here that I'm not quite making. Really? Yeah. I'm unhappy with this note system right now. It's too coarsely factored.

It's not sufficiently atomic. Insight you're making is making too many claims at once. Trying to figure out how to factor this a little better so that I can access the part that is most relevant to this confusion about design and bound. It's difficult to separate the parable of the, Hindu Arabic numerals from these core claims of insight through making. I guess the issue is that, the claims are very abstract, and they need to be concretized through example, through a specific situation.

So I'm finding myself wanting to refactor this this note into a lot of notes right now, and I'm also asking myself, is that is that really what I wanna do right now with this writing session? I think it's probably not. So I'm trying to figure out what my next step is. Step back to what I was doing over here. I don't like this note.

It's just not saying very much. It's very vague and design. Schoolie, honestly, anything that's abstract. It's kind of necessarily that way. I'm not sure I'm going to keep this note.

This is not a great Yeah. Try to unpack these claims at least a little bit. Maybe I won't refactor the whole page yet, but I'm gonna put it back into my inbox because it just needs a lot more work. Why? What a ridiculous sentence this is.

I think it's clearly it's it's clearly demonstrated with the fact that I don't really understand this. That's okay for now, I think. What I'm really trying to say here, I think I'm trying to say these core insights through like, basically, I'm trying to make this insight through making claim. Which seems to align with this claim. And maybe it aligns with this claim.

I mean, I think this is again a very consultancy heavy claim. Yeah. And worst worst detection. We're seeing compatibility. Poor question.

It's like Yeah. This this phrase underlying subject matters, one Michael and I really wrestled with. I don't It's pretty big. I'm a little lost, so I'm gonna try to just articulate some questions, some finer grain things I think I know. To what extent can a professional designer operating a studio practice?

Create systems which express profound subject matter insight. If this is is indeed impossible, And where can such systems come from? Did they require training the subject matter experts in system design? I think I'm gonna try moving laterally a little bit and see if I can unpack this claim, which does not seem tied to the book. So it has a shot of actually being evergreen.

I have a bunch of comments about arterialism and dig through those. None of them actually really seem very relevant to you. That's interesting. Very surprised that word out to where it doesn't appear anywhere in my notes. Alright.

So let's see. I'm trying to write an evergreen note that claims, Great work is you leave the results. Product of a single person. It's just a core claim about authorship. Maybe this maybe this isn't always true.

I mean, it certainly isn't. Where do I wanna go with this? Imventions interesting. Lots of fun examples, but, often, it's more textured and complex with invention. So I'm not quite sure I wanna include invention.

Just wanted to ask why this might be might be, And there's some relationships here to some prior notes I've written, that I will try to find. Alright. That's nice. Now this is actually linked into things. Alright.

We got one real evergreen note out of this whole thing. That's good. And now I I feel comfortable now that I've framed this in my own thinking, I feel reasonably comfortable adding the, the verbatims from this book, which give it some more texture. Let me get the actual page number. Okay.

This is kind of a decent note now. That's good. I have a tag here, in my inbox called study that I use for notes that are representing kind of books and things I'm reading and studying. Distinguish these from things in my inbox that are more ideas that I'm trying to explore and flush out because I use different times to do those things. I tend not to use my mornings to like write notes about books.

It's kind of a lower effort activity. I I try to use the mornings to develop, ideas that I've been working on. And, the reason why I'm working on this this morning is that, I'm not I'm not really writing notes about this book. I'm noticing a tension between some core claims of this book and, some ideas that I've been developing, and I'm trying to understand those tensions. And you can see by kind of the the speed at which I'm making progress here, and the degree of confusion.

This is the kind of, kind of work I prefer doing in the morning. If all I'm trying to do is just, like, take notes on the book, it's a much less confusing process, but it's also a much less productive process. Alright. So where are we landing? We're we're, about 90 minutes in.

I'm gonna need to take a break here in a minute, so I'll probably turn off the live stream. Let's see if we can land in a place that actually, has some finality now that I I'll kind of return to this core tension for, you know, one last time. Where are we at? Try one one more time in new. Alright.

So inventing truly powerful new systems seems to require both systems design expertise and also subject matter expertise. See, insight through making and the invention. Got some sync conflicts, I guess. I think the live streaming process is really slowing down my computer and creating some interesting issues. Yeah.

Okay. Alright. So it seems to require these things. The traditional design really approach also, advocated in design unbound, is to, have the designer act as orchestrator, in addition to synthesis and visionary. But, great creative work is usually the product of a single person.

The designer is not a domain expert. But okay. In the processes in okay. So in typical design processes, because the designer acts as the, catalyst and synthesize, Producing the skilled creative vision from the one's contributions. This is a little incoherent.

That means Right. Yep. Okay. I think that's the core of it. I'm actually reasonably happy with this summary.

Is this Evergreen? Is there a name I can give to this? That would be a nice bow to put on all of this. Think of it kinda is. Let's give it a shot.

This systems of action node. I I'm probably just gonna ditch this note. Yeah. I think the name I can give to this is something like, typical design practices. Cancer.

Educational design practices. Can't produce systems which require profound subject matter insight. That's not a terrible title. One thing that makes me uncomfortable here is I'm not this isn't yet enormously different from what Michael and I have articulated in t t f t. I haven't incorporated enough of design on diamond into this.

But this I think is the key differentiator in this to hey, Shabir. My puppy is coming. Say hi. Alright. Can we do one more pass on this?

It's still not quite sharp, and I need to link to it from a few places in order to kind of weave it into I'm doing here. I'm gonna bring in, Am I doing here? Also, gonna bring in this piece. There's there's elements of this that I'm not really incorporating in here yet, which probably should be incorporated. Alright.

This is, I think, going to be the other place where I'll bring in ideas from this book. I was just saying how I didn't like this note. Where did it go? There we go. Alright.

The sentence is quite confused now, syntactically, but it's sharper in terms of understanding and concept. Right. I checked the page number. Okay. Actually, reasonably happy with that.

At least it's a first start. So I think it will end there. That might be enough for me to write an email. We'll see. That It was an interesting experiment with the screencasting.

I don't really know how well it worked. I probably chose too difficult a writing session to really demonstrate anything terribly interesting, other than hearing me be confused for an hour and a half. But, yeah, gotta experiment to, to get anywhere. So there we go. Have a good day, y'all.
