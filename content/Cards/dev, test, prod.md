dev, test, prod means different things to different people. In the context of my set of digital gardens (Obsidian vaults) notes/ideas fall into these categories:

- `dev`: these are ideas I explore on my own. I might not ever talk about them but they seem worth caching (because [[Collectorâ€™s Fallacy|being a collector is okay|]]). They are [[Obsidian]] notes where I can meander, explore. It might not connect to any project (currently). It might be day-to-day trivia... like I log what I ate the other day... 
- `test`: ideas I might bounce off a friend or co-worker 
- `preprod`: maybe something ready for a wider audience
- `prod`: stuff I think should be shared widely

.... is there some overlap with [[divergent and convergent thinking]]? Maybe this falls to the left of the [[Double Diamond (design process model)]].
