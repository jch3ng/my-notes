[[Collectorâ€™s Fallacy]] seems to overlap with Quadrant 3 of the [[Eisenhower Decision Matrix]] where it can be about guilt and shame about things you enjoy. In both cases you treat it too much in a black/white way.... I've done this.

I've come to terms with Quadrant 3. You can burn yourself out if you go full, all-in 100% workbot mode for too long if you overly interpret or overly implement [[Eisenhower Decision Matrix]] for not just work, but how you live.
