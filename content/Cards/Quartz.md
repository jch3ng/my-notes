While there's official [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started, I had good luck with Nicole van der Hoeven's [How to publish Obsidian notes with Quartz on GitHub Pages](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages#Change+the+%60origin%60+remote)

This was a backburner projects, until sometime in the middle of [[2024-W30]]. The lag from my paid [[Obsidian Publish]] account doesn't fit my workflow:
- make edit
- publish
- lag in the current browser
- reload in Incognito mode (works great)

.. and the real reason, was my main vault is Dataview heavy. I was hoping Quartz would work with Dataview and that maybe all current docs were magically out of date. I then found: https://joschua.io/posts/2023/09/01/obsidian-publish-dataview/
