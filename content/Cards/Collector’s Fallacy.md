Maybe mulling over and responding to `=this.link`  is a [[Idea Maze|trap]]! but it leads to https://zettelkasten.de/posts/knowledge-cycle-efficiently-organize-writing-projects/ which intuitively to me makes sense.

[["Collector’s Fallacy" seems to overlap with Quadrant 3 of the Eisenhower Matrix]]

I like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/123x73e/comment/jdwv0gi/)'s take:

> insight is not temporally bound. The assumption of those who cry "collector's fallacy" is that insight is gained only at the time of capture, importation, and note networking. As if storing and engaging _later_ is somehow "less than."

The quadrillion small [[Obsidian]] notes I keep are long tail bets on "emergent value": at some point in time, when I `command+O` that note will connect and add value in some way. It might not fit the project or task I really need to do in the moment, but it builds incremental momentum on something else.

The unsaid part being that _they_ don't do such things, but rather make good use of their feverish imports, while at the same time elevating the term to some sort of universal metric of "good sensemaking."
